# Columnist

[![tests](https://github.com/cgay/columnist/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cgay/columnist/.github/workflows/test.yml)


Columnist helps create columnar text output from sequences (rows) of data.  For a good
example of what I'm trying to create here, see [this Python
project](https://github.com/acksmaggart/columnar).

The initial version of Columnist is, however, far more humble. The goal is simply to help
making prettier output for [`deft --help` and `deft
list`](https://package.opendylan.org/deft/index.html).
